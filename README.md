# WebApp
***
This project has been written as part of my internship at the microelectronic lab of the University of Bologna. The aim was to built an interactive webapp for the organization, plotting and data analysis of simulations data, given as .cdv files.

To install the app execute the file install_all_pkgs.bat, a python virtual enviroment will be created in the execution directory, and required packages will be installed. After the installation, the app will be startable, executing the file app.py in the just created venv, or executing the file start.bat.

Add a directory named 'data' to the current directory, or, in alternative, start the app, modify the data_dir path from the app Config Page, save and restart the application.
